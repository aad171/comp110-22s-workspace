However, the data can't be argued with in a literal sense, so I have to take it to mean what it says. In any case, I don't see how still implementing my idea of creating basic outlines of new concept implementations to start us off creating new examples would be harmful. It will still be a fantastic way to study for midterms and the final exam and gives us a better understanding of individual concepts rather than implementing all of our knowledge in the next exercise. For this reason I don't see how this idea would negatively impact any of the stakeholders, create any negative tradeoffs, or have any negative potential costs, other than the additional time that would need to be put in my the teachings staff and students should they wish to take advantage of the extra material.\n",
